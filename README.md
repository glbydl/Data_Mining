1.LSH and Recommendation Systems
This project is for finding similar users who love watching movies.
I use LSH algorithm to computer their similarity.
After that, we recommend films to them. (Their similar users watched but they didn't)

2.Kmeans Algorithm
This project is for finding a k* point to stop dividing input into different clusterings.
I implemented kmeans algorithm which is very classic to do this.

3.Compute Betweenness
This project is for computing betweenness in a graphic network.
Just the same as above, it is a good way to decide which one is the key point in the whole network.
Based on the betweenness, we can determine how to cut the network into clusterings.
